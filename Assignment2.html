It was the pure bond and love that kept both united, not marriage. Because every love story doesn't end in marriage.</p> <p>Radha was married and she even tried to cease the feelings she had for Lord Krishna but it did not work. She there and then accepted her devotion to Lord Krishna.The bond of love between Lord Krishna and Radha was not physical, rather it was a spiritual and pure form of devotion. So, it is said that Lord Krishna and Radha are two different manifestations of the divine principle of Krishna & Radha.</p><h4>- Trust of Love ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤
